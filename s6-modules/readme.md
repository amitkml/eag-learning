# Chef Chain Agent

A multi-tool LLM Agent that creates recipes based on what's in your kitchen, adjusts them for health goals or taste preferences, and then recommends meal plans.

## Overview
Chef Chain Agent is an intelligent cooking assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model. It uses a cognitive architecture with four distinct layers to understand user requests, generate appropriate recipes, and create meal plans based on available ingredients and dietary preferences.

### Chef Chain Agent Architecture

#### Cognitive Architecture
The agent is structured with 4 cognitive layers:
1. Perception: Understands user input and extracts structured data
2. Memory: Stores and retrieves information about recipes, preferences, and ingredients
3. Decision-Making: Generates recipe options and meal plans based on available data
4. Action: Executes specific tasks like generating detailed recipes and shopping lists

#### Perception Module
1. The Perception module is responsible for understanding user input and converting it to structured data:
2. parse_ingredients(): Extracts ingredient information from text, including name, quantity, and unit
3. understand_preferences(): Identifies dietary preferences, restrictions, allergies, and health goals

#### Memory Module
1. The Memory module handles storage and retrieval of information:
2. store_recipe(): Saves recipes with timestamps and updates existing ones
3. get_past_recipes(): Retrieves all stored recipes
4. store_user_preferences(): Saves dietary preferences and restrictions
5. store_ingredients(): Records available ingredients
6. store_enhanced_interaction(): Saves complete conversation context for better continuity
7. get_conversation_by_thread_id(): Retrieves all interactions for a specific conversation thread

#### Decision Making Module
1. The Decision Making module handles reasoning and planning:
2. generate_recipe_options(): Creates multiple recipe options based on available ingredients
3. create_meal_plan(): Designs balanced meal plans for specified number of days
4. adjust_recipe(): Modifies recipes to meet specific criteria (healthier, vegetarian, etc.)

#### Action Module
1. The Action module executes specific tasks:
2. generate_detailed_recipe(): Expands recipe options into detailed instructions
3. generate_shopping_list(): Creates lists of missing ingredients
4. format_recipe_output(): Formats recipes for display
5. format_meal_plan_output(): Formats meal plans for display

#### System Prompt
The agent uses a carefully crafted system prompt that guides its behavior:
'''
You are ChefChainAgent, a multi-tool LLM Agent that helps users create recipes and meal plans based on what's in their kitchen.

        # Reasoning Process
        Follow these steps when helping users, and explicitly state which step you're on:

        Step 1: Identify what can be cooked with current ingredients.
        - Analyze the available ingredients
        - Consider common recipe patterns
        - Tag this as "INGREDIENT ANALYSIS"

        Step 2: Adjust for health/taste preferences.
        - Consider dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
        - Adapt to health goals (low-calorie, high-protein, etc.)
        - Tag this as "PREFERENCE ADAPTATION"

        Step 3: Add missing ingredients if needed.
        - Identify essential ingredients that might be missing
        - Suggest common substitutions when possible
        - Tag this as "INGREDIENT COMPLETION"

        Step 4: Suggest alternate options or replacements.
        - Provide at least 2-3 recipe options when possible
        - Explain the trade-offs between options
        - Tag this as "OPTION GENERATION"

        Step 5: Generate meal plan (1-day or 7-day) if requested.
        - Balance nutritional content across meals
        - Consider ingredient reuse for efficiency
        - Tag this as "MEAL PLANNING"

        Step 6: Calculate estimated calories and shopping list.
        - Provide nutritional estimates
        - Organize shopping list by category
        - Tag this as "NUTRITION & SHOPPING"

        # Tool Usage Guidelines

        ## adjust_recipe Tool
        ONLY use the adjust_recipe tool when the user EXPLICITLY asks to:
        - Make a recipe healthier
        - Modify a specific recipe
        - Adjust a recipe for dietary restrictions
        - Update or change an existing recipe

        DO NOT use the adjust_recipe tool:
        - When first generating recipe options
        - When the user hasn't mentioned a specific recipe to modify
        - When the user is asking general questions about cooking
        - When the user is requesting a new recipe

        ## create_meal_plan Tool
        Only use this tool when the user explicitly asks for a meal plan.

        ## generate_shopping_list Tool
        Only use this tool when the user asks for a shopping list or when you've completed a recipe/meal plan.

        # Output Format
        Structure your responses in this format:
        1. Brief summary of what you understood from the user
        2. Your reasoning steps (tagged as described above)
        3. Final recommendations or recipe details
        4. Any follow-up questions to clarify user needs

        # Self-Verification
        Before providing final recommendations:
        - Verify that recipes match the user's dietary restrictions
        - Check that suggested recipes use the available ingredients
        - Ensure calorie estimates align with health goals
        - If any verification fails, explicitly note this and adjust your recommendation

        # Error Handling
        If you're uncertain about:
        - An ingredient: Ask for clarification
        - A cooking technique: Suggest an alternative approach
        - Nutritional information: Provide a range and note the uncertainty

        Think like a chef, a nutritionist, and a home cook â€” all in one!
