# Gmail MCP Integration Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a Gmail integration using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system allows AI assistants to interact with Gmail, enabling operations such as checking unread emails, sending emails, and marking emails as read.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **MCP Gmail Server (`mcp_gmail.py`)**: Provides Gmail-specific tools through the MCP interface
2. **MCP Client (`tack2mcp_gmail.py`)**: Connects to the server and provides a user interface
3. **Authentication Layer**: Handles OAuth2 authentication with Google's Gmail API

## Client-Server Communication

The client and server communicate using the MCP protocol:

1. Client initializes a connection to the server
2. Client requests available tools
3. Client creates a system prompt with tool descriptions
4. Client sends user queries to the LLM
5. LLM generates function calls based on the system prompt
6. Client executes the function calls on the server
7. Server returns results to the client
8. Client displays results to the user

## Security Considerations

1. **OAuth Tokens**: Stored in `token.json`, should be protected
2. **Credentials**: `credentials.json` contains sensitive OAuth client information
3. **Email Content**: The system has access to potentially sensitive email content

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Filtering**: Add tools to filter emails by sender, date, or content
2. **Attachment Handling**: Add support for viewing and downloading attachments
3. **Email Organization**: Add tools for organizing emails (labels, folders)
4. **Multi-user Support**: Support multiple user accounts
5. **Email Templates**: Add support for email templates
6. **Rich Text Emails**: Support HTML formatting in sent emails

## Comparison with Existing MCP Paint Implementation

The Gmail MCP implementation follows a similar pattern to the Paint MCP implementation:

| Feature | Paint MCP | Gmail MCP |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Server | `mcp_paint_server.py` | `mcp_gmail.py` |
| Client | `talk2mcp_paint.py` | `tack2mcp_gmail.py` |
| Authentication | Windows API | Google OAuth |
| Primary Tools | Drawing operations | Email operations |
| Tool Structure | Similar `@mcp.tool()` pattern | Similar `@mcp.tool()` pattern |
| Response Format | TextContent objects | TextContent objects |

The main differences are in the specific tools provided and the external API integration (Windows API vs. Gmail API).

## Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling:

1. **Authentication Errors**: Detected and reported with clear instructions
2. **API Errors**: Caught and formatted for user display
3. **Parameter Validation**: Input parameters are validated before API calls
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function even if some operations fail

## Installation and Setup

To set up the Gmail MCP integration:

1. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client mcp
   ```

2. Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console:
   - Enable the Gmail API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application)
   - Download as `credentials.json`

3. Run the server:
   ```
   python mcp_gmail.py
   ```

4. Run the client:
   ```
   python tack2mcp_gmail.py
   ```

## Conclusion

The Gmail MCP integration provides a powerful interface for AI assistants to interact with Gmail. By leveraging the MCP framework, it enables structured, tool-based access to email functionality while maintaining a clean separation between the client and server components.
